# Bluff (Cheat / I Doubt It / BS) - Rules

Bluff is a fun and fast-paced card game where players try to get rid of all their cards by playing them face-down and (possibly) lying about what they played. Other players must decide whether to **trust** or **call the bluff**.

---

## Objective

- Be the first player to **get rid of all your cards**.

---

## Setup

- Players: **3–6** recommended (works with 2+).
- Deck: **Standard 52-card deck**. For large groups, use 2 decks shuffled together.
- Deal all cards evenly among players. Some players may have one card more than others.

---

## Gameplay

### Turn Order

- Play moves **clockwise**.

### Starting

- The player with the **Ace of Spades** (or any chosen card) begins.
- They announce **which rank they are playing** (e.g., "One Ace") and place one or more cards **face down** in the center pile.

### On Each Turn

1. A player must declare a rank **in sequence** from the previous one:
   - Standard sequence: A, 2, 3 … 10, J, Q, K, then back to A.
   - Example: If the last player announced "Two 5s," the next player must announce "Six(es)."
2. The player may:
   - **Play truthfully** (place the actual next-rank cards they hold), or
   - **Bluff** (place different cards but still announce the required rank).

---

## Challenging a Bluff

- At any time **immediately after a turn**, any player may say:
  - **"Bluff!"**, **"Cheat!"**, or **"I doubt it!"**
- The pile is then **revealed**:
  - If the player **lied** → They **take the entire pile** into their hand.
  - If the player **told the truth** → The challenger **takes the pile**.

---

## Continuing Play

- After a challenge is resolved, the next player continues with the required sequence.
- If no one challenges, play continues normally.

---

## Winning

- The **first player to empty their hand** wins the game.
- If multiple players go out in the same round (e.g., through a final bluff), the game can be scored:
  - **First out = 1st place,** etc.

---

## Variations

- **Free Rank Declaration**: Instead of fixed sequence, players can announce any rank on their turn.
- **Multiple Decks**: Makes bluffing easier and harder to track.
- **Silent Bluff**: Players place cards without declaring aloud; next player just follows sequence silently.
- **Scoring Mode**: Play multiple rounds, giving points to the winner(s). Lowest total points after X rounds wins.

---

## Example Round

1. Player A: "Two 7s" (places 2 cards face down).
2. Player B: "One 8" (places 1 card face down).
3. Player C: Says "Bluff!" → Cards revealed.
   - If B actually played an 8 → C takes the pile.
   - If B lied → B takes the pile.
4. Play continues with 9s.

## Strategy Tips

- Bluff when others are unlikely to call you.
- Track which ranks have already been played.
- Call bluff when you strongly suspect dishonesty, but beware of being wrong!
